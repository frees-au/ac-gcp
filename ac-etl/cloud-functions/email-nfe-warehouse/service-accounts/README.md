See .env.yaml for the needed accounts.

Key files are json files which are generated by going to the
service account in GCP and "Keys" tab. You can use the same service
account for multiple roles, but the script assumes they are
different for security isolation.

Next level of security is to put these in secrets manager. Even though
they are not committed into the repository, they get pushed to GCP
in the deployment. So currently you can see these files if you have read access to the cloud functions Source tab, or the source from where they are deployed (currently a laptop).
